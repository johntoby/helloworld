This is my first repository on GitHub, This repo is to house my helloworld project, and to enable me understand how Git and GitHub works. 
I am a 35 year old young man resident in Abuja Nigeria. I really wanna learn web development as i find it a fun thing to play with HTML and CSS. 
I am now into learning Vanilla Javascript and hopefully will be done with that, befre moving to a JS framework. I heard Vue.Js is the in-thing currently, as jQuery, Angular and React.JS are getting obsolete. Thats what Im gonna learn, Vue.JS.
